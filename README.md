There's four dangers you must face:

Notifications. Click and swipe them off to the right

Discord. Increases for each Discord notification closed. Max 15. Click to reset

Recycling bin. Increases for each non-Discord notification closed. Max 15. Click to reset

CPU overheating. Click on the fire extinguisher in the taskbar then click on the temperature bar/title to lower the temp lol



Notifications will come faster and faster as you clear more notifications (0.08% faster per notification). The CPU temp will also heat up faster as more notifications are cleared (1/sec every 140 notifications). See how long you can last!

Extraneous controls:

F11 toggles fulllscreen

Escape would pause except in the browser it un-fullscreens so you can also press the windows/start button in the bottom right to pause

Space instantly spawns another notification if you're getting cocky.
